### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these issues:

- `good first issue` - issues that should only require a few lines of code
- `help wanted` - issues that should be a bit more involved than beginner issues

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Virtual environment tool (venv, conda, etc.)

### Setup Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaygandhi129/Cluster-Manipulation-Tool.git
cd Cluster-Manipulation-Tool
```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Install development dependencies:**
```bash
pip install pytest black flake8 mypy
```

5. **Run the application:**
```bash

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

- **Line length**: 88 characters (Black default)
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports where possible
- **Docstrings**: Use Google style docstrings
- **Type hints**: Use type hints for function parameters and return values

### Code Formatting

We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting:

```bash
black app/ tests/
```

### Linting

We use [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting:

```bash
flake8 app/ tests/
```

### Type Checking

We use [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking:

```bash
mypy app/
```

### Example Code Style

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional


class ExampleClass:
    """Example class demonstrating code style.
    
    Args:
        data: Input data dictionary
        options: Optional configuration options
    """
    
    def __init__(self, data: Dict[str, any], options: Optional[Dict] = None):
        self.data = data
        self.options = options or {}
    
    def process_data(self, filter_term: str = "") -> List[Dict]:
        """Process the input data with optional filtering.
        
        Args:
            filter_term: Optional string to filter results
            
        Returns:
            List of processed data dictionaries
            
        Raises:
            ValueError: If data is invalid
        """
        if not self.data:
            raise ValueError("No data provided")
            
        # Implementation here
        return []
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

Run the test suite:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=app/ --cov-report=html
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Follow the naming convention: `test_<function_name>`
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Mock external dependencies

Example test:

```python
import pytest
from app.cluster_manager import ClusterManager


class TestClusterManager:
    def test_load_valid_data_success(self):
        """Test loading valid cluster data succeeds."""
        manager = ClusterManager()
        valid_data = {
            "clusters": [
                {
                    "id": "1",
                    "name": "Test Cluster",
                    "members": [{"id": "m1", "name": "Member 1"}],
                    "relationships": []
                }
            ]
        }
        
        success, message = manager.load_data(valid_data)
        
        assert success is True
        assert message == "data_loaded"
        assert len(manager.data["clusters"]) == 1
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch** from `main` for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards

3. **Add or update tests** for your changes

4. **Run the test suite** and ensure all tests pass

5. **Run linting and formatting**:
   ```bash
   black app/ tests/
   flake8 app/ tests/
   mypy app/
   ```

6. **Update documentation** if needed

7. **Commit your changes** with a clear commit message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description of changes"
   ```

8. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

9. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Use a clear title** that describes what the PR does
- **Fill out the PR template** completely
- **Reference any related issues** using keywords like "Fixes #123"
